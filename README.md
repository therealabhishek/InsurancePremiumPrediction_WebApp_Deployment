# InsurPrice: Predicting Insurance Premium using AI


### What is the need of InsurPrice?

- Health and Medical Insurance is the need of the hour, especially when the cost of living in the major cities are rising exhorbitantly each year. We have also seen that a pandemic like Covid can arise unannounced and lead to major medical expenses on the families. Hence, it is advisable to have a Health Insurance. With it you can atleast reduce the medical expenses.
- But, what is more important is that the Insurance should be rightly priced. It should not be so high that the premium of the insurance defeats the purpose of insurance.
- Thus, using InsurPrice we will predict the insurance expenses using AI/Machine Learning models based on the customer data so as to get the right premium for the insurance policy and avoid overpaying, also, the insurance companies can get a better idea as to what premium to charge.


### What data do we have?

- We have data which have 1338 rows and 7 columns.

- The columns are as follows:
1. age - indicates the age of the patient
2. sex - indicates the gender of the patient
3. bmi - indicates the body mass index of the patient
4. children - indicates the number of children the patient has
5. smoker - indicates whether the patient is a smoker
6. region - indicates the region in which the patient lives
7. expenses - indicates the premium paid by the patient

- In this case, the 'expenses' columns is the one we will predict using Machine Learning.
